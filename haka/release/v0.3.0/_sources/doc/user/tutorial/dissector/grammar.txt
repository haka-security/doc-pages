Grammar building blocks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Haka grammar is made of basic blocks and coumpound blocks. The former enables
parsing of basic elements such as booleans (:haka:func:`flag`), bytes
(:haka:func:`bytes`), number (:haka:func:`number`), regular expression
(:haka:func:`token`), etc. The latter allows to form complex blocks by combining
basic and compound blocks. For instance, the `record` block (:haka:func:`record`)
is used to define a structure of elements.

Creating the grammar
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Smtp protocol grammar is defined through the following skeleton where we define
protocol messages syntax. Then, we can export the root elements of our grammar
in order to compile them and make them ready to be parsed:

.. code-block:: lua

    SmtpDissector.grammar = haka.grammar.new("smtp", function ()

        ....

        smtp_command = entity{
            ...
        }

        smtp_reponse = entity{
            ...
        }

        smtp_data = entity{
            ...
        }

        export(smtp_command, smtp_response, smtp_data)
    end)

Specifying terminal enitites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Here, we give the definition of terminal entities that will be used to specify
smtp messages structure:

.. code-block:: lua

    WS = token('[[:blank:]]+')
    CRLF = token('[%r]?[%n]')

    SEP = token('[- ]'))
    COMMAND = token('[[:alpha:]]+'))
    MESSAGE = token('[^%r%n]*'))
    CODE = token('[0-9]{3}'))

    PARAM = record{
        WS,
        field('parameter', MESSAGE)
    }

The first ones are self explanatory. `PARAM` is defined using the `record`
keyword wich represents consecutive elements.

Specifying protocol message syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We distinguish three SMTP messages: commands, responses and data (mail content). Hereafter, we give their specification using the Haka grammar.

SMTP commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following RFC 2821, smtp command messages are alphabetic chars terminated by a CRLF. Command themselves are followed by white space(s) if paramters are present. These parameters could be required (MAIL, RCPT), optional (HELP) or not permitted at all (DATA, QUIT). These information is stored in the following table which will be used later by the grammar to adapt dissection according to parsed smtp commands:

.. code-block:: lua

    local CMD = {
          ['HELO'] = 'required',
          ['EHLO'] = 'required',
          ['MAIL'] = 'required',
          ['RCPT'] = 'required',
          ['DATA'] = 'none',
         ['RESET'] = 'none',
        ['VERIFY'] = 'required',
        ['EXPAND'] = 'required',
          ['HELP'] = 'optional',
          ['NOOP'] = 'optional',
          ['QUIT'] = 'none'
    }

The syntax of smtp command messages is defined as a `record` starting with a command name (defined previusouly as terminal token) and ending with a CRLF. We use the `branch` entity to distinguish between the three configuration cases:

* Parameters must follow.
* Parameters may be present.
* No parameters follow.

The `branch` entity is endowed with a selection function allowing to select the branch to follow depending on the command name. Note that the grammar has a special element `optional` allowing to handle cases where messages may be present or not. In our case, we detect if paramteres are present by looking one byte further if CRLF is present. This is done thanks to the `lookahead` function (see :doc:`\../../../ref/grammar`)

.. code-block:: lua

    smtp_command = record {
        field('command', COMMAND),
        branch(
            {
                required = PARAM,
                optional = optional(PARAM,
                    function(self, ctx)
                        local la = ctx:lookahead()
                        return not (la == 0xa or la == 0xd)
                    end
                ),
                none = empty()
            },
            function (self, ctx)
                return CMD[self.command]
            end
        ),
        CRLF
    }

SMTP responses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A smtp response message is defined as a status code followed by a separator, a comprehensive message and a trailing CRLF:

.. code-block:: lua

    smtp_response = record {
        field('code', CODE),
        field('sep', SEP),
        field('parameter', MESSAGE),
        CRLF
    }

Smtp server may respond by a sequence of response messages which are captured in Haka grammar using an `array` entity. The array size is determined thanks to the `untilcond` option (i.e. hyphen is missing in the last response message):

.. code-block:: lua

	smtp_responses = field('responses',
		array(smtp_response)
			:untilcond(function (elem, ctx)
				return elem and elem.sep == ' '
			end)
		)

.. note:: `untilcond` is an array option that returns true to indicate that we have reached the end of the array. See :doc:`\../../../ref/grammar` to get the list of available options.

SMTP data
~~~~~~~~~

Finally, data content is defined as following:

.. code-block:: lua

    smtp_data = record {
        field('data', bytes()
            :untiltoken("%r?%n%.%r?%n")),
        token("%r?%n%.%r?%n")
    }
