Registering events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Events are created by invoking `register_event` method wich takes as first argument an event name. For our needs, we will create three events:

.. code-block:: lua

    SmtpDissector:register_event('command')
    SmtpDissector:register_event('response')
    SmtpDissector:register_streamed_event('mail_content')

Note that the last one (`mail_content`) is a stream-based event that takes a signaling function as extra argument to cope with data availability.

Triggering events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Events are triggered by invoking `trigger` method which is usually done after successfully parsing a message block. We pass to the `trigger` method the event name and a list of parameters that will be available later to the security rule through `eval`'s arguments. For instance, the following call is made while parsing a smtp command in the state machine:

.. code-block:: lua

    self:trigger('command', self.smtp)

.. note:: `self` is an instance of smtp dissector.
