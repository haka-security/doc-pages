Getting started
===============

Running Haka
------------

.. program:: haka

``haka`` is primarily intended to be used as a daemon. This daemon will usually use a configuration file
given on the command line using the `-c` option.

The following command will launch ``haka`` from the command line using an example configuration file:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd <haka_install_path>/share/haka/sample/gettingstarted
    $ sudo haka -c gettingstarted.conf

Sample configuration
--------------------

The content of the file ``gettingstarted.conf`` is detailed below :

.. literalinclude:: ../../sample/gettingstarted/gettingstarted.conf
    :language: ini
    :tab-width: 4

This configuration file instructs ``haka`` to capture packets from interface
*eth0* using nfqueue and to filter them based on the Lua policy script
``gettingstarted.lua``

First Haka policy file
----------------------

The content of the file ``gettingstarted.lua`` is detailed below :

.. literalinclude:: ../../sample/gettingstarted/gettingstarted.lua
    :language: lua
    :tab-width: 4

This script starts by loading the required protocol dissectors - namely the
ipv4 and tcp modules - then specifies two security rules. The first rule is
evaluated whenever a new tcp packet is received. It allows to drop packets with
invalid checksums. The second rule is triggered each time a new tcp connection
is established. Its only purpose is to add a log entry if the packet is
addressed to a specific ip address and port.

Going further
-------------

Other documented examples are available to illustrate all features of Haka.
Those samples are installed in ``<haka_install_path>/share/haka/sample`` and
the corresponding documentation can be found at :doc:`tutorial`.
