Haka documentation
------------------

The Haka documentation contains 3 sections which are described here:

* :doc:`User guide <../userindex>`: contains introduction to the Haka
  tool suite as well as tutorials. It is the best start if you want to start lerning what
  Haka can do.

* :doc:`User reference guide <../../ref/refindex>`: for the whole API. It
  provides description and examples for all functions and concepts that need to be used
  inside an Haka configuration.

* :doc:`Developer guide <../../developer/devindex>`: if you like to dig deeper into
  the core of Haka, this section will explain how to compile and present the C API and
  concepts.
