Hakabana
========

Hakabana is a monitoring tool that uses Kibana and Elasticsearch to visualize
traffic passing through Haka in *real-time*. The package is already installed
in the haka-live iso but can be downloaded directly from http://www.haka-security.org.

Getting started
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hakabana module is installed at ``/usr/share/haka/modules/misc/hakabana``.
It consists of a set of security rules that export network traffic to
Elasticsearch server. They are then displayed thanks to our Kibana dashboard.

Hakabana ships with a default configuration allowing starting quickly with
traffic monitoring. It is available in ``/usr/share/haka/hakabana``

.. admonition:: Exercise

    * follow the instruction below to start haka:

    .. code-block:: console

        cd /usr/share/haka/hakabana
        sudo haka -c haka.conf

    * visit the url: http://localhost/kibana/ and load hakabana dashboard
      from ``/usr/share/haka/hakabana/dashboard/``

I want more DNS info
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Your goal here is to customize the security rules in order to export extra data.

.. admonition:: Exercise

    * update the ``dns.lua`` in order to export dns types.

    * add a panel to hakabana dashboard to display dns types.


Geo localization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hakabana features a `geoip` module allowing to get the country code associated to an ip
address. Here is an example using it:

.. code-block:: lua

    local ipv4 = require('protocol/ipv4')

    local geoip_module = require('misc/geoip')
    local geoip = geoip_module.open('/usr/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat')

    haka.rule {
        hook = ipv4.events.receive_packet,
        eval = function (pkt)
            local dst = pkt.dst
            haka.log("geoip", "ip %s from %s",dst, geoip:country(dst))
        end
    }

.. admonition:: Exercise

    * update the ``flow.lua`` file in order to exclude traffic addressed to a given
      country.
