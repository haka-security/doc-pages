Hellopacket
===========

As a basic example to get up to speed with Haka this section will help you to
learn how to create basic rules, access data from the packets and display
logging information and security alerts.

Setting up my first Haka script
-------------------------------

Haka configuration is done with script file. Haka scripts are mainly Lua
files. To put a first step into Haka we are going to write a small script aiming
to log every ip packet passing through Haka.

Let's get started by opening your first script with your favorite editor:

.. admonition:: Exercise

    .. code-block:: console

        $ editor hellopacket.lua

Modules
^^^^^^^

Each Haka script must tells Haka which modules it will need. In Haka, dissectors
*are* modules. As our goal is to log every ip packet we will need ``ip``
module.

.. code-block:: lua

    local ipv4 = require('protocol/ipv4')

Lua allow modules to be set in a local variable. Every Haka module use this
feature to avoid contaminating the global state.  Haka provides only one keyword on
the global state: ``haka``. This is the starting point of every functionality
provided by Haka.

Rules
^^^^^

Haka is *event* based. It will trigger event to let you verify some property and
react if needed. You can declare these checks and reactions with Haka *rules*.

If we sum up, Haka rules are made of:

    * an event to hook to
    * a Lua function to check and react

We can declare our first rule by adding the following lines in our ``hellopacket.lua`` script:

.. code-block:: lua

    haka.rule{
        hook = ipv4.events.receive_packet,
        eval = function (pkt)
            -- Do some check on pkt and react if necessary
        end
    }

Each dissector will trigger its own events. The event you hook to determines the
arguments passed to the ``eval`` function. You can find a full list of the available
events and their arguments in the documentation.

.. seealso:: `Ipv4 <../../../modules/protocol/ipv4/doc/ipv4.html>`_ where
    you will find the event list of ipv4 dissector.

Logs
^^^^

Finally, Haka provides some log and alert facilities. As you might already have
guess, you can find it under ``haka`` keyword. Now we can finish our first Haka
script by adding the following line in the eval function inside the rule:

.. code-block:: lua

    haka.log("Hello", "packet from %s to %s", pkt.src, pkt.dst)

Additionally you can throw an alert with ``haka.alert``. For example the
following code will throw an alert of low severity:

.. code-block:: lua

    haka.alert{
        description = "A simple alert",
        severity = "low"
    }

.. note:: The alerts are targeted to network administrators, they contain security
    information that could be reported in some kind of monitoring tool. You can check
    the alert description in the reference guide.

.. admonition:: Exercise

    Write your first haka rule using logging and alert facilities.

Running the script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that your first script is finished you might want to see it in action. You
can simply use ``hakapcap`` to test it on a provided pcap file (:download:`hellopacket.pcap`):

.. code-block:: console

    $ hakapcap hellopacket.lua hellopacket.pcap

Full script
^^^^^^^^^^^

For ease of simplicity you can download the full script here :download:`hellopacket.lua`.

Optional: Interactive rule
--------------------------

Now you should have all the prerequisite to have some fun with Haka. But soon
you will complain that it can be quite boring to go back and forth between your
script and the documentation.

In order to ease the development steps of your script Haka provides a magic eval
function named ``interactive_rule``. If you use it, Haka will stop and you will
see a prompt which allow to enter Lua commands.

Here is an example of an interactive rule:

.. code-block:: lua

    local ipv4 = require('protocol/ipv4')

    haka.rule{
        hook = ipv4.events.receive_packet,
        eval = haka.interactive_rule("my_interactive_rule_on_ip")
    }

It is strongly recommended to use interactive rules on pcap. If you try to use
it on real traffic and if you are not fast enough you will encounter lots of
retransmit packets.
