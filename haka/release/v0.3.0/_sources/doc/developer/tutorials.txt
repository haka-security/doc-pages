Writing Haka extensions
=======================

Haka has a modular architecture and you can extend it by adding your favorite
module.

We provide here a Makefile to compile your source files, link your module
against haka libraries and have it installed on haka target path.

.. note:: You are free to use your own compilation toolchain.

In the following, we will create a sample C module ``mymodule`` that exports a
single function ``myfunc``.

First, create a directory ``mymodule`` and two sub folders ``src`` and ``obj``.
In the former, create your source and header files:

.. code-block:: c

    mymodule
    \--obj
    \--src
       \--mymodule.c
       \--mymodule.h
       \--mymodule.i
    \--Makefile

The source file ``mymodule.c`` must include a module structure that sets the
type of the module to ``MODULE_EXTENSION`` along with other information such as
the name and the author of the module:

.. code-block:: c

    struct module MY_MODULE = {
        type:        MODULE_EXTENSION,
        name:        L"my module",
        description: L"my module",
        api_version: HAKA_API_VERSION,
        init:        init,
        cleanup:     cleanup
    };

The module code must also defines a initialization and a cleanup function that
will be called when the module loads and unloads, respectively.

.. code-block:: c

    static int init(struct parameters args)//
    {
        messagef(HAKA_LOG_INFO, L"mymodule", L"init my module");
        return 0;
    }

    static void cleanup()
    {
        messagef(HAKA_LOG_INFO, L"mymodule", L"cleanup my module");
    }

Here is the :download:`mymodule.c <../../sample/mymodule/src/mymodule.c>` which defines
also the ``myfunc`` function that we want to export.

Then, we have created a single header file :download:`mymodule.h <../../sample/mymodule/src/mymodule.h>`
That simply defines the prototype of the function ``myfunc``.

Finally, in Haka we use `SWIG <http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/Lua.html>`_ to bind C
functions to Lua objects. Here is the content of our swig file
:download:`mymodule.i<../../sample/mymodule/src/mymodule.i>` that binds the ``myfunc`` function.

.. note:: for more complex binding, you can have a look at C protocol modules in
    Haka source tree.

The last step is to compile (``make``) our newly created module using the
following :download:`Makefile <../../sample/mymodule/Makefile>` that must be created in the main
module folder.

.. literalinclude:: ../../sample/mymodule/Makefile
    :tab-width: 4
    :language: makefile

.. note:: You may need to adjust the HAKA_PATH variable.

Now, we are ready to use the module in haka script files. Here is a sample file
that simply calls the ``myfunc`` function:

.. literalinclude:: ../../sample/mymodule/rule.lua
    :tab-width: 4
    :language: lua
